# Some Cool Features
A (in my opinion) simple yet cool little website I made
## It has:
* Title animation: a one screen large intro page with a title: "Hey there, welcome to my place". One word in this title is animated with a few stars and a gradient type of text. This kind of title is also present in the 'pictures' section.
* Navmenus (including gigantism): on the bottom of the main page you can find a navMenu covering the whole screen. On hover you will see a cool gradient background appearing. Once you clicked on the pictures section you will see a navBar at the top.
* Again on the pictures section you will find an effect that uses simple math to display some pictures from the [Unsplash website](https://www.unsplash.com) in a cool way.

## That's it
I hope the site is visualy appealing to you. If you have any questions regarding the website or me or anything else, feel free to send me an e-mail at sven@royer.se
